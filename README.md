# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-MRI
VGG16 model-based classification project about brain tumor detection.

Me and my friend have done the pre-task given by Teknofest "AI in Healthcare" competition. 
So it's the classification project and it's only clustered the brain tomography into 'yes' and 'no' folders. 

While I was doing that, used a CNN model to classificate the images. 
And I've create a VGG16 model to do these processes. 

As you already know, AlexNET is the best model to predict healthcare datas. 
In the following days, I will perform classification tasks with other models starting with AlexNet and upload them to my repo.
